# BMI706 Project

To start the project run the command: `./start.sh <env_name>` inside terminal, where `<env_name>` corresponds to the name of your local conda environment. For instance, if you have an environment called `bmi706`, you would run the command as: `./start.sh bmi706`. If there are any issues, you may need to change the permissions of the file by first running `chmod +x start.sh`.

This will activate your conda environment and then start the streamlit app locally.
